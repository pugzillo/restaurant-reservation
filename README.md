Linh Chau

> You have been hired as a full stack developer at _Periodic Tables_, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
> The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.
> At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

# Deployment Links
[Heroku](https://restaurant-client-linh.herokuapp.com/dashboard)

## Technologies used
- Client-side Application made with React.
- UI and CSS styling primarily handled with Bootstrap.
- Back-end API made with Node and Express.
- API communicates with a PostgreSQL database hosted pn ElephantSQL.
- SQL queries in the API are made with Knex.
- Client-side and back-end Applications are both deployed with Heroku.
- Unit testing handled with Jest.
- Supertest used for back-end tests.
- Puppeteer used for end-2-end tests.


## Existing files

This repository is set up as a *monorepo*, meaning that the frontend and backend projects are in one repository. This allows you to open both projects in the same editor.

As you work through the user stories listed later in this document, you will be writing code that allows your frontend and backend applications to talk to each other. You will also write code to allow your controllers and services to connect to, and query, your PostgreSQL database via [Knex](http://knexjs.org/).

The table below describes the folders in this starter repository:

| Folder/file path | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./back-end`     | The backend project, which runs on `localhost:5000` by default.  |
| `./front-end`    | The frontend project, which runs on `localhost:3000` by default. |


## Local database setup

1. Set up three new ElephantSQL database instances - development, test, and production - by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Creating & Deleting Databases" checkpoint.
1. After setting up your database instances, connect DBeaver to your new database instances by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Installing DBeaver" checkpoint.

### Knex

Run `npx knex` commands from within the `back-end` folder, which is where the `knexfile.js` file is located.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. Update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. Run `cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env`.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5000`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.
